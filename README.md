# PblHomebrew6bitBinaryWithDate
This is my first working modification of MyNameIsKir's Binary Watch watchface for the Pebble Smart Watch (https://github.com/MyNameIsKir/Pebble-Binary-Watch-C). Most of the code is hers; I just fumbled around with some modifications--namely, I changed it from an 8-bit-per-line display to a 6-bit used a different, larger font added the old-school green-on-black "homebrew" color scheme and moved the date from a separate window and integrated it with the time display.

Many thanks to MyNameIsKir for her help and her work.
